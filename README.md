__Assignment Description:__
<br/>
Task: You have a program which is parallelized and uses 𝑛 independent threads to process the given list of 𝑚
jobs. Threads take jobs in the order they are given in the input. If there is a free thread, it immediately
takes the next job from the list. If a thread has started processing a job, it doesn’t interrupt or stop
until it finishes processing the job. If several threads try to take jobs from the list simultaneously, the
thread with smaller index takes the job. For each job you know exactly how long will it take any thread
to process this job, and this time is the same for all the threads. You need to determine for each job
which thread will process it and when will it start processing.
<br/>
<br/>
Input Format: The first line of the input contains integers 𝑛 and 𝑚.
The second line contains 𝑚 integers 𝑡𝑖 — the times in seconds it takes any thread to process 𝑖-th job.
The times are given in the same order as they are in the list from which threads take jobs.
Threads are indexed starting from 0.
<br/>
<br/>
Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105; 1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 105; 0 ≤ 𝑡𝑖 ≤ 109.
<br/>
<br/>
Output Format: Output exactly 𝑚 lines. 𝑖-th line (0-based index is used) should contain two spaceseparated
integers — the 0-based index of the thread which will process the 𝑖-th job and the time
in seconds when it will start processing that job.

If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and won’t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)"
